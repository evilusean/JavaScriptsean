MVC Design pattern(Model view controller): Use proper design pattern same way as companies
Professional UI, Clean, responsive, - can use a bootstrap template 
project MUST use a database, must perform CRUD(create read update and delete) option,  
login page/security+authentication/authorization- can use Auth0/Firebase, 
solve a business problem
SRS = software requirement specification=write down all the features and benefits you want it to have- divide each feature and complete in 1 week sprints
  Track progress, take notes so you can talk about it during interview, just focus on each part as it comes up, use the bug tracker you are building to track progress
  can show bugtracker that you built with the progress along the way, show construction phase with SRS
Build the project with the tech stack you will be applying for- Web Dev = MERNS, he recommends: .net ndc and c# - not applying for a software dev posistion
(DaGram Project already has all these-just not built in react.)
