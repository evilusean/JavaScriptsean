Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

The Mac I'm using is 10 years old, running High Sierra, I can not upgrade past 10.13.6 , I can't even run node, which means I can not run react, or next.js or yarn

In order to get a new mac, I need to create cool projects, to get a job, to buy a new mac, but I can't create cool projects without a new mac. cycle of suffering. Canada is purgatory for anyone with an IQ above 100. I can not escape this frozen decadent hellscape. Suffer.
