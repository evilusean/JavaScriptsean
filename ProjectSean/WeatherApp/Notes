Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.


'.env.local' after copying API key, create a new file in src directory, NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_KEY = <API KEY> #replace <> with actual api key, after that you can use it globally whereever you want
  in .env.local your API key will be stored privately, so that our API key is not exposed publicly

https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3
// original api call only found the city, you need to change /data/2.5/forecast add a city, and country, add a limit, and API key in .env.local in the src / app directory
// there is another that does lat/long we could also use
// http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name},{state code},{country code}&limit={limit}&appid={API key}
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Tokyo,JP&appid={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY}&cnt=1
// Above code cnt=56 means 56 hours of data with 3 hours of difference, cnt=1 is 1 hour, for our weatherapp css tokyo skyline project, we just need the weather as of that moment user checked
Pipes used to read API data, will need for tokyo css skyline project
