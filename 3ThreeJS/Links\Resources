Host ThreeJS on Github Pages:
https://sbcode.net/threejs/github-pages/#:~:text=js%20and%20possibly%20some%20extra,E.g.%2C%20My%2DProject%20.

Going to start small, crawl -> walk -> run, going to make either a moon that gives a light source depending on mouse position or an eye that follows mouse position (or both) before I start working on a landing page 
Github Pages SHOULD in theory be able to host threeJS projects, so I'm just going to build it here, if I need to I can host on vercel, but I want to save my 5(3 now) free hosts for webapps
Need to watch some videos/tutorials to see where to start,

Start after Kanban board - halfway done - already planning on next one xD, 
moon cycles with lighting dependant on cursor, Tsuki no Me Keikaku, synthwave background, blender editing, maybe matrix rain again?(will be using a canvas again), maybe zoomout, kawasaki ninja if I can find a free model, step 1 - kanban
Road going through center, mountains at start, fall away from hero image, as scroll down page, zooms out, kawasaki/car delorean driving side by side, synthwave/tron lights - Do we need a story board? Infinite Zoom Out

2B -> Black Silhouette -> Acheron -> Black Silhouette -> Waifu Scroll / Pepe scroll same concept - kinda like animorphs but with pepes on scroll - the hero with a thousand faces - 2D AnimASeans
Once I get good with the lighting could make some sick horrorcore stuff - Try to stick to one/few Thematic, don't want it to be too 'busy' can always build more later, after I escape canada - just needs to be enough to git a job
  What is more horrifying than being stuck in canada surrounded by canadians and their new canadian pets paying half of your income to be abused by brainwashed idiots for decades who poison kids because the TV tells them too.. not much
Stranger Things S4 Particle AEffects mindflayer + red sky/moon aesthetics or go for a synthwave build with blues/pinks + road + kawasaki/delorean or NPC horde vs the the sentient few / pepe evolusean - many opseans
Magic 8 Ball / DJ Mixer + YT links / Floating eye follows mouse / Moon phases / spider or particles vs mouse interactivity / soijack + NPC horde / Blackeyed souljack with depression spirals 'Owari da' - It's over /
  basically learn how to do particle aeffects on HTML and use a 2D foreground with animated background 
NPC Horde + NPC Borg Cube (geometry+Mesh) + The Wall - create a custom mesh that can be used on solid/fluids/particles -
