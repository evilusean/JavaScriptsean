Host ThreeJS on Github Pages:
https://sbcode.net/threejs/github-pages/#:~:text=js%20and%20possibly%20some%20extra,E.g.%2C%20My%2DProject%20.

Going to start small, crawl -> walk -> run, going to make either a moon that gives a light source depending on mouse position or an eye that follows mouse position (or both) before I start working on a landing page 
Github Pages SHOULD in theory be able to host threeJS projects, so I'm just going to build it here, if I need to I can host on vercel, but I want to save my 5(3 now) free hosts for webapps
Need to watch some videos/tutorials to see where to start,

Start after Kanban board - halfway done - already planning on next one xD, 
moon cycles with lighting dependant on cursor, Tsuki no Me Keikaku, synthwave background, blender editing, maybe matrix rain again?(will be using a canvas again), maybe zoomout, kawasaki ninja if I can find a free model, step 1 - kanban
Road going through center, mountains at start, fall away from hero image, as scroll down page, zooms out, kawasaki/car delorean driving side by side, synthwave/tron lights - Do we need a story board? Infinite Zoom Out
InspireASean: https://youtube.com/watch?v=96G0ngElPWk&ab_channel=DVRST&t=40
2B -> Black Silhouette -> Acheron -> Black Silhouette -> Waifu Scroll / Pepe scroll same concept - kinda like animorphs but with pepes on scroll - the hero with a thousand faces - 2D AnimASeans
Once I get good with the lighting could make some sick horrorcore stuff - Try to stick to one/few Thematic, don't want it to be too 'busy' can always build more later, after I escape canada - just needs to be enough to git a job
  What is more horrifying than being stuck in canada surrounded by canadians and their new canadian pets paying half of your income to be abused by brainwashed idiots for decades who poison kids because the TV tells them too.. not much
Stranger Things S4 Particle AEffects mindflayer + red sky/moon aesthetics or go for a synthwave build with blues/pinks + road + kawasaki/delorean or NPC horde vs the the sentient few / pepe evolusean - many opseans
Magic 8 Ball / DJ Mixer + YT links / Floating eye follows mouse / Moon phases / spider or particles vs mouse interactivity / soijack + NPC horde / Blackeyed souljack with depression spirals 'Owari da' - It's over /
  basically learn how to do particle aeffects on HTML and use a 2D foreground with animated background 
NPC Horde + NPC Borg Cube (geometry+Mesh) + The Wall - create a custom mesh that can be used on solid/fluids/particles - NPC Vaxcattle RayTracing Game '"My Magic $cience Juice Won't Work if You Don't Get Yours Too"' - Snipez
  Like CoD zombies, but the NPC horde is harmless to those whom are harming them, and in fact runs up to them, and aggros on to those whom are trying to help them - '"TRUST THE $CIENCE"' - '"POISON KIDZ 2 SAVE GRANDMA!!"'
  X Wing Star Wars Knock Off - Go into the NPC Borg Cube(death star) and skywalker the 0 could also use raytracing + WASD controls - minigame - I feel like I'm getting just a little too ambitious here - scope
  Lol, just thought of another game - cursor = vax, NPC's spawn in randomly, and run towards the cursor and TU-MOR WEEKS TO FLATTEN THE CURVE - ACK - BOOOOOOOOSTED - DYSENTRY SUDDENLY OREGON TRAIL - Not One Apology - TUMOR HUMOR
    The actual objective is to try to keep as many of the mindless brainwashed idiot herd alive as you can but they keep running into the danger despite your best efforts shouting platitudes and cliches, +time += spawnrate
    Ultimately a nihilistic game, unwinnable, futile, much like living around these brainwashed conformie cowardly idiots, the sentient are forced to suffer the abuses of the idiots, My perceptSean of others will never recOVER -Its Over
    If you can keep >50 alive, you get the borg cube and can then move onto the next stage - have different NPC's fast ones who ACK quicker - slow fat ones who are obstacles who can take 8+ acks and get fully BOOOOOOOSTED - etc

Can Add Different AnimASeans to my CV2 canvas that I used for 'Matrix Rain' simply add a new .js and hook it up to the canvas, if they click a new button, clear the canvas and do the new animasean - 2DaMoon AnimASean - Needs moon mesh
https://github.com/evilusean/CourseraGoogleFCC/blob/main/FCC-ThreeJS-5Projects/1Basics/index.js
Copy Most of code from above, add to CV2, just replace the mesh on the iso geo with moon mesh, and orbit already works, automatically zooms in, add red color, IlluminASean, hollow moon theory confirmed, 
const hemiLight = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0xffffff, 0x000000); #change from white/black to red/black - add a moon mesh to a sphere, and with below code, you will now have a moon AnimASean- Could also do earth + Japan
scene.add(hemiLight);
function animate(t = 0) {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    mesh.scale.setScalar(Math.cos(t * 0.001) + 1.0) //Will cause the orb to shrink and expand over and over again 2DaMoon
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
